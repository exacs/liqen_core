  Manages everything related to user accounts and its authentication.

  ## Notes

  - This module doesn't manage permissions or roles. It only gives an interface
    to handle with identities.
  - This module doesn't have any session mechanism like tokens.
  - This module defines a type `t:user/0` which is a "public" representation of
    a user. Functions that returns a user will return this `t:user/0`. Do not
    confuse with `LiqenCore.Accounts.User` which is an internal module.
