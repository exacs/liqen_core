# LiqenCore

The Core of Liqen, rewritten.

## Why?

In the past, we created Liqen Core as a Web Application using the [Phoenix Framework](http://phoenixframework.com).

Now, the framework is updated to version 1.3. And, if you have seen [this video presentating it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMO28ar0lW8) you will notice a change of mindset to develop with it.

So, LiqenCore is no longer a Web Application created using Phoenix.

Now, it is an Elixir Application with a Web layer on top of it.
